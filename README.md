Agents with the ability to derive new conclusions from the currently given informations instead of just using them are one step closer to intelligence. The Wumpus world is one problem that requires such abilities from an agent. In the course **CSC14003: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**, we studied propositional logic, ways to represent them including the Conjunctive Normal Form and how we can apply them to make our agent move intelligently in the Wumpus world.
